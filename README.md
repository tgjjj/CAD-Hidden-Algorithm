# CAD-Hidden-Algorithm
Implementations of Scanline Z Buffer and Spanning Scanline hidden algorithms for my CAD class assignment.

The program is written with c++ STL and OpenCV library, in which OpenCV is only used for storing and displaying images.

The two algorithms basically use the same data structure, where only an additional patch (a vector) is added to the Spanning Scanline algorithm to accelerate it.

The algorithms are not well optimized due to lack of time, and I'll be really glad to receive any advise on this program.
