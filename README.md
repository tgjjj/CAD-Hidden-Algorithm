# CAD-Hidden-Algorithm
Implementations of Scanline Z Buffer and Spanning Scanline hidden algorithms for my CAD class assignment.

The program is written by visual studio 2017 with c++ STL and OpenCV 3.4.8, in which OpenCV is only used for storing and displaying images.
  
Please notice that the algorithms are not that well optimized due to lack of time.
